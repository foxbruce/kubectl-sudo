# kubectl sudo

## TL;DR
```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "bofh" cannot list nodes at the cluster scope
```

```bash
$ kubectl sudo get nodes
NAME                     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
kubelet1.example.com     Ready    <none>   96d   v1.11.2
kubelet2.example.com     Ready    <none>   96d   v1.11.2
```

This project does not really introduce a kubectl plugin but a concept
of how to provide a sudo like system for kubernetes access.

Kubernetes cluster administrators have great power. This means that a mistake they do
could cause the cluster to become unhealthy or insecure and, as such, could impact
any or all tenants sharing the cluster. A simple `kubectl -f` on a file with
wrong namespaces defined can end badly.

To reduce the surface of unwanted or unexpected actions you can reduce the default priviledges
a cluster administrator has to the level of an unpriviledged account and give them the ability to impersonate users and groups.
When a cluster administrator needs to do more priviledged actions he/she can switch
the group to `system:masters` or another group or user according to the needed privilidge level.

In order to implement that you need to declare a `ClusterRole` for impersonation:
```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: impersonator
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  verbs: ["impersonate"]
  resources: ["users", "groups", "serviceaccounts"]
```

Now you can assign the ClusterRole to the cluster administrators (e.g. group `bofh_accounts`):
```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-administrators
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: impersonator
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: bofh_accounts
```

Any user which has the group `bofh_accounts` can now do administrator tasks like:

```
kubectl --as=$USER --as-group=system:masters delete node kubelet3.example.com
```

The provided kubectl plugin is a wrapper for kubectl to shorten the `--as` and `--as-group` part.

## Plugin Installation
`./bash/kubectl-sudo` must be placed anywhere in `$PATH`, named `kubectl-sudo` with execute permissions.  
For further information, see the offical documentation on plugins [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/).

## Plugin Compatibility
Works on systems with `/bin/sh` and kubectl >= 1.12. `kubectl` must be inside `$PATH`.

## Examples
Usage example:
```
$ kubectl get nodes
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "bofh" cannot list nodes at the cluster scope

$ kubectl sudo get nodes
NAME                     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
kubelet1.example.com     Ready    <none>   96d   v1.11.2
kubelet2.example.com     Ready    <none>   96d   v1.11.2
```

Audit log will contain the origin and the impersonated user and group, if configured correctly:
```json
{
  "kind": "Event",
  "apiVersion": "audit.k8s.io/v1beta1",
  "level": "Metadata",
  "stage": "ResponseComplete",
  "requestURI": "/api/v1/nodes?limit=500",
  "verb": "list",
  "user": {
    "username": "bofh",
    "groups": [
      "bofh_accounts",
      "system:authenticated"
    ]
  },
  "impersonatedUser": {
    "username": "bofh",
    " groups": [
      "system:masters"
    ]
  },
  "objectRef": {
    "resource": "nodes",
    "apiVersion": "v1"
  },
  ...
}
```
